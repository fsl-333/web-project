            <img src="img/Dammam.jpg" alt="Dammam city">
            <p>Dammam, city, eastern Saudi Arabia. It lies on the Persian Gulf northwest of Bahrain Island and forms a
                larger
                metropolitan and industrial complex with Khobar, Qatif, and Dhahran. The discovery of immense oil
                reserves in
                the locality in 1938 led to the radical transformation of the once small coastal settlement into a
                boomtown that
                is now a major seaport, a petroleum and natural gas centre, the commercial hub of eastern Saudi Arabia,
                and the
                eastern terminus of the railroad to Riyadh. Dammam is strikingly modern, with sprawling suburbs; most of
                the
                city has been built since the 1940s. Apart from the oil industry, the city’s economy is supported by
                agriculture, especially dairying. Large herds of imported beef and dairy cattle are kept on experimental
                farms.
                King Faisal University opened in the city in 1975. In 1999 King Fahd International Airport opened.</p>

            <p>Marjan Island is an artificial, beautiful small island connected to the nearby city of Dammam by road.
                There is

                good
                enjoyment. It is a good spot for arranging picnics and fun family getaways. There is a tower that you
                can climb
                to get a panoramic view of the corniche, particularly at night, and enjoy a picturesque view of the
                surroundings. It is a great getaway for those who want to enjoy a slice of nature! It is better to visit
                at
                sunrise or sunset time for a wonderful view. It’s an ideal fishing spot also. It’s a beautiful place to
                spend
                some time for a picnic, walking, relaxing, and taking photos. Kids enjoy the location where they can
                enjoy
                slides and swings. There are tent-like areas where you can sit and have your meal. There is ample
                parking
                available on the Island. We found the toilets clean. There are many convenience/cart shops and movable
                stores
                where you can get eatables, snacks, and refreshments. Some other activities one can indulge in are the
                sea lion
                show, cruise trip, water bike ride, speed boating ride, and other functions. In short, it is a worth
